# HangMan_Game
Welcome to Hangman!

This is a text-based Hangman game where you can guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

Here's how the game works:

-> The game starts with a hidden word, and you have 6 lives.
-> You can guess letters, and if the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
-> If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.
-> You can guess letters until you have used up all your lives or until you have guessed the entire word.
-> If you guess the entire word correctly, you win! If you run out of lives, you lose.
Let's get started!
